--React js  is based on java script
--less lerning curve
--we can use third party library (most of time we have to  go for third party library its a disadvantage of react)
--react js library uses virtual DOM or react DOM=>?

*react is a library
*single page appalication (Reacts)
* while using the funcanality of the appalication it won't refreh 
   react use for both
* to make single page appalication we use routing 
* react can be used for single page appalication 
* Most of the single pages will have one html file 
* page should hot refresh when you navigaet inside same appalication
 
To start with react we should use two library
1) React library        (JS)
2) React Dom library    (JS)

3)what is CDN link (two cdn lick of js)
4)what is min.css
  minified version of css to (minimise the page loading condation it will be minified)

official link of js (react.org)

why react js but not angular ?

why we need react library and DOM library

                                            (--------------------------22/09/2021---------------------)

--->to creat react element we need react library(React.creatElement)
--->to render the element that your are created in virtul use react dom element(ReactDom.render)
--->virtul dom takes the react element to the real DOM(Document object model)
    take two parameter 
1 prameter-what you want render
2 where do you want render this element 

props--combinaion of children and attributes (2nd and 3rd parameter in creat element ) 
react element is javascript object.each children are react element 
js people take this object and creat virtual dom element then later react library will update
real dom element 
props can take any negative value that can be primitives and refrence

when you are looping through array of elements

In react when you want to loop use map method 

3) Diffing algorithm- this code will compare the two virtul ie., virtul dom older one and updated virtul dom 
    (time complexity --how much time it takes  and space complexity---number of space required)
  diffing algorithm used to compare virtual DOM, Updated virtul DOM and real DOM which takes less time
 
(Read diffing Algorithm)!

 Key attribute is added so that the comparision becoms easizer

   JSX---Javascript + XML (Extention of javascript)
   const element = <h1> Hello world</h1> ==> (const element= React.createElement('h1', {id:demo} 'Helloworld')
                (JSX)                                     ()                           (id:demo=value can be any primitive or refrence type)

  Babel---(all the process does not support code b/s of versions like ES6 ES5) it will convert it in to a version so that which all the browser can understand 
        and it will convert JSX element to react element 
only in case when you are writing jsx if it includes javascript code the this js code should be written in side{}, when we write 

components--- it is also a piece of code --creat the component once and reuse the code again and agian 
** Alway start component with capital word (if you writ in lower case it will try consider as DOM element)
In js we have 1)class component 
              !2)finctional components---we  must use only it or most the time we use functional component. 
                 [class header extends React.component---then class will become reat component]
             render(){
                       return <h1>header</h1>
                      }
In class component we have to use this key word to access this.props.fristName
using props in class component and function component  prps.fristName

* sate variable in class component 
* props cannot be changed it's just a read only property.props are immutable
* In class components we can directly write the methods
*  when ever you access the method are property in class component you should use (this.)
constructor (){
}--
  when ever you extend an class you should pass supper inside constructure
  bind method will creat a copy of function, methods and arrars strings

 *supper--- it will call the super class constructur 
  properties and methods initalized in supper class it  will be inherited to sub class

* when ever you want to change the data dinamically we have to use the state
   by initilizing state with object ie.,{"",} or inside constructur
   constructur(){
   this.state{
   fristb name :"Ajay" 
}  
when ever you loop it use key word 
  - we should never used this.state.fristname ="vijay" to change or mutate the state name insted of that 
     method setState ({fristName:""vijay})
   state is for class component

INTERVIEW QUESTION

React-Before-16.8vs
==>state component (state full component)
  * class components have state  
  * Life cycle(and life cycel methods)
  * because of state, dynamically we can change
  * return method
  * class extends recet.components 
  * we should use this key word to access props(we have constructur components)
  * state full component

==>function component (another name state less component)
  * Dosen't have state component 
  * there is no life cycle methods 
  * life cycle methods are not present
  * no state no dynamic activity 
  * no constructon components
  * another name state less component
  
-- After 16.8vs functional components have state components all 
    
  <people/>----component
  we can call child component inside the parent component by passing "<componentname/>" inside parent component 
  when ever you want pass the data from parent to child use props

(------------24/09/2021-----------)

 todo list

  passing data from child to parent
 * creat a function in parent component 
 * pass the function as a props to child component
 * call the function in child component using props and pass the parameter
                           or
 * In the parent component, create a callback function. ...
 * Pass the callback function to the child as a props from the parent component.
 * The child component calls the parent callback function using props and passes the data to the parent component.

WHAT IS THE USE OF STATE AND setState

state should away be an object
!setState()

INTERVIEW QUESTION

props 
*props are immutable 
*props are read only
*props can be passed to to child component and can be used
*


state
-states are mutable
--if state is in present in parent component  cannot pass if you want to pass to child component then it should be passed through props (state as a props) and this state cannot be changed by child component 
  state can only be modified in the state where it is declered(if we want to mutate you should mutate in same com  ponent )
--state is asynchronous
  locally scoped

interview question 
 !set state is ascynchroners
-setState is used to update the state
-setState with asynh and awite 

INTERVIEW QUESTION

What is life cycle? where there is a start and end 

----component also have life cycle 
     
 classs component 

    class component has three phase:-
 ==>mounting phase(mounting to )--constructur is the frist method that is getting executed (
     what you do in constructue
     * initilization
     * bind the method )
     *  we should not make any side effect ---(side effect ie., we should not upmdate dom, making API call ))

 ==>we should use static methods---getDerivedStateFromProps(static,state)
     * we can return getDerivedStateFromProps to change state or update
     --never do setState inside render method [render method comes after (getDerivedStateFromProps)] we can return null here
       |
    [render]
       | after render only DidMount come in to pitcher
==> componentDidMount
    *we scan do side effect 
    *update state (up dating your dom,making api calls )

2)updating phase(it will also execute props)
 ===> getDerivedStateFromProps ---it is the frist method will be executed
  when this will come in to pitcher means when ever you change state using set state 
 ===>shouldComponentUpdate (for this method you can return either true false. by default it is true)
     if true is executed from shouldComponentUpdate it will execute render method other wise it will stop.
     (most of the time it will be false)
                   |
                 render
                   |
                   |
===>getSnapshotBeforUdate(previousprops,previousstate) befor up dating the realDOM it excuted executly just befor the render method.  (here you can return  data and this will be passsed as a third parament to componentDid update)
===>componentDidMountUpdate (here you can do side efffects and interact with real DOM )
   (previousprops,previousstate)(previousprops,previousstate)
  


3)unmounting phase
===>componentWillUnmount

 here we do all the cleaning process,detach event (login and log out is the example)

how to creat the state 
 out side constructor use ---just --state{}
 inside connstructor use  this.state{}
 to combine tow object use spread operator


 16.8vs
state in functional componens
  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!  interview Question
React hooks is only used for functional component not for class

!React Hooks----nothig but basic plain javascript function 
 
how do we creat sate in component ===using functional component ------->
 const myState = React.useState (u can pass initial state it can be strig object number ... any primitive and refrence )
                                  (in class component only objects are passed)
const nameSate = React.useState ("Ajith")
 new state return an array [state, function] --- FUNCTION IS USED TO UP DATE THE STATE
                indexNumber   0       1 
        0 index is always have state 
        1 is the function use to update the state
 const [name, setname] = react.useState("ajith")
       if u want to update call setName="murali"
       ex if age   setAge =23
    in functional component we can use any number of state but in class componen we should use only one  
ex const [age, setage] = react.useState("ajith")
const [person, setperson] = react.useState("{fristName}")

!!!with object 

when you are doing setState in function it will update only the key which your updated but remaning will not and it will delet there it sefl
***intrnally in  setState, spread operatror happens 
 but setSate in function for object while updating the object  wes should use spraed operator if not it will up date only the updated pointed key---

synthatic event-----

preventDefault---prevent the default behaviour of your HTML (LIKE ANCHOT tag,p ,h ,a)


                                                     (---------basic coverd up to Now--------------) 

two way data binding is not there in reactue to 
for two way data banging 
bind the value to object and
 on change event update valuet to object

onChange event
event.tagret.value-----to take data from inout in js

*packege.json
*README.md

to work with react we need these three library
 1)react library
 2)React Dom
 3)Babel

  when ever we use npx and creat project all packeg will pe there 

>>>node-modules--which includes all the library
>>>public --all the static files will be present inside this folder ex:-index.html

...>>> git-inore--> all the node module will be here it will push the src file 
      *** node models will not be pushed for git
...>>>package.lock.json-- json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package. json 
                          (it is created dependent on pakage.json)   it will be having detailed information like 
...>>>pakage.json-->  consist of bascic info of projectall the dependence will be present inside the project (all packeges and its version detalis of app )

when you downlode the project from git you will be not having node-model ,in cmd
-->>>>(npm install or npm i) if u dint have node module use this code to generate ---node module will be created based on the libarary and version 
...>>>package-lagljson- will have all the information of json 
...>>>README.MD--WILL HAVE INFROMATION OF THE PROJECT gvrn by the developer

* src---->>> all the javascript code html and css dynamic code where Be will write here.

--app.test.js---here we write the test cases
   we write one file for one component 
---index.css 

---indx.html>

(./) means current directory

npm strats 
 react-scripts start--->src--->html--->js-->components

exporting the component (when you export it is not necessary to import )

        a.js                                     b.js
function sum {                          import sum from"./a.js" (when it is default )
                                        import a from "./js" (in 'sum' variable you can give any name )                                 
}

export sum (normal:it will export as an object each will be specified with key value )
            (while importing non default it should de structur and use . same name should be given or you can give alliyas name,but while in programinig you should these name and {}should be used )
eport default sum(default export, to whole file there should be only one default export )

***any primitive and refrence can be export
***when you import in library no need to give name just give (import React from 'react')
***recat is the default export
./ current direectory
** other than default export call in curly breces 


importing the component 

shortcut
rfc---to react function component here export default will be created at the top
rfce--to react function component (e export default come down)
rcc---react class component here export default will be created at the top
rce---rect class component and (e export default come down)
imr---import from react
imrc---import react from component 
imbrc---


Always keep the state at the top level

(react-router-dom) prevent refreshing in achor tag
npm i-react-router-dom
npm i --save react-router-dom


react router 
 link
 route
 browser router
*insted of anchor tag use link tag  (that browser will not refresh does not have href attribute insted we have to="/____")
*<Route path="/" component={Home}> meaning
 when path is / about then load this about component 
*all routing should be enclosed with browser router <BrowserRouter></BrowserRouter>
* we creat saperate file router.js
*exact--it will match exactly the attribute

HOC--Higher order component withRouter(component)
while exporting you shold export with router

steps=---check the version of git  in cmd====>  git --version

windows up date should be complited 

sorce code --->cmd--->
1) creat folder
2) in cmd type (git init)---- which will creat .git in folder
3)git config --global user.email "you@example.com"---(write your email without "" )
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"---(write your git name without "" )
4)git add "New Text Document.txt"(with in "" write your folder name )
5)git commit -m "add" (with in "" write any name)
6)git status (check for git status)
7)Repository name in git web--- here we get an url------ this url shoul be loaded in cmd like below
8)git remote add origin (Url) ----https://github.com/Muralidharab/folder.git
9)git push -u origin master  (here the folder is pushed )
